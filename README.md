# Bike Sharing

## Overview
The purpose of the analysis is to use pubically available information to glean insights into who is using the CitiBike program in NYC. The insights will be used to justify starting a similar bike rental program in Des Moines.

## Results

### Summary
Based on the data from the 2019 file, the average rider is male and he's a regular user of the service.  He's decided to get a membership instead of using the service as a one-off.  The user rents the bikes for prolonged periods and probably rents and drops off at the same location. This could be his primary form of transportation. The user rents between 7am - 9am or 5pm - 7pm Monday to Friday.

### Most frequent pick-off and drop-off locations
There's a lot of overlap between the locations where bikes are picked up and dropped off. Of the 10 busiest locations where bikes are picked up, 8 are also the busiest drop off locations. This might indicate that people live close to the CitiBike location.  Once they've finished their daily task, they return the bike to the same location.

### What times are the most popular
People are using the service for extended periods throughout the day. The highest frequency trip duration is 5 hours. The busiest times of day for the service is 6am to 9am and then 5pm to 7pm Monday to Friday. People are primarily using the service during a typical work week.

### Is there a gender bias regarding users
Both men and women use CitiBikes, but men are much heavier users of the service.  The most popular times that bikes are rented are similar for both women and men.

## Summary
The typical user of CitiBike is male and he's a regular user of the service.  He's decided to get a membership instead of using the service as a one-off.  The user rents the bikes for prolonged periods and probably rents and drops off at the same location. This could be his primary form of transportation. The user rents between 7am - 9am or 5pm - 7pm Monday to Friday.

Two visualizations would be interesting to look at; the average age of the user and the usage by month. The usage is probably affected by the weather.  It would be helpful to know how much the usage changes by month to know how the business would be impacted by winter. The age would be useful as a way to understand the size of the available market in Des Monines.
